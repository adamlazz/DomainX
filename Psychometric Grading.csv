,Purpose:,"eRm fits Rasch models (RM), linear logistic test models (LLTM), rating scale model (RSM), linear rating scale models (LRSM), partial credit models (PCM), linear partial credit models (LPCM), and linear logistic test models with relaxed assumptions (LLRA).","A number of routines for personality, psychometrics and experimental psychology. Functions are primarily for scale construction using factor analysis, cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although others provide basic descriptive statistics. Item Response Theory is done using factor analysis of tetrachoric and polychoric correlations. Functions for simulating particular item and test structures are included. Several functions serve as a useful front end for structural equation modeling. Graphical displays of path diagrams, factor analysis and structural equation models are created using basic graphics. Some of the functions are written to support a book on psychometrics as well as publications in personality research.?","Estimates Rasch models and mixture Rasch models, including the dichotomous Rasch model, the rating scale model, and the partial credit model.","Coefficients of Interrater Reliability and Agreement for quantitative, ordinal and nominal data: ICC, Finn-Coefficient, Robinson'A, Kendall's W, Cohen's Kappa, ...","Indices, heuristics and strategies to help determine the number of factors/components to retain: 1. Acceleration factor (af with or without Parallel Analysis); 2. Optimal Coordinates (noc with or without Parallel Analysis); 3. Parallel analysis (components, factors and bootstrap); 4. lambda > mean(lambda) (Kaiser, CFA and related); 5. Cattell-Nelson-Gorsuch (CNG); 6. Zoski and Jurs multiple regression (b, t and p); 7.

This package fits many models and distribution by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or penalized MLE. Also fits constrained ordination models in ecology.","The package includes marginal and joint maximum likelihood estimation of uni- and multidimensional item response models (Rasch, 2PL, Generalized Partial Credit, Rating Scale, Multi Facets), fit statistics, standard error estimation, as well as plausible value imputation and weighted likelihood estimation of ability.","Contains functions useful for correlation theory, meta-analysis (validity-generalization), reliability, item analysis, inter-rater reliability, and classical utility","Analysis of multivariate dichotomous and polytomous data using latent trait models under the Item Response Theory approach. It includes the Rasch, the Two-Parameter Logistic, the Birnbaum's Three-Parameter, the Graded Response, and the Generalized Partial Credit Models.","This package performs simple and canonical CA (covariates on rows/columns) on a two-way frequency table (with missings) by means of SVD. Different scaling methods (standard, centroid, Benzecri, Goodman) as well as various plots including confidence ellipsoids are provided.","This package estimates factor analysis models using a genetic algorithm, which permits a general mechanism for restricted optimization with arbitrary restrictions that are chosen at run time with the help of a GUI.","Fit a variety of latent variable models, including confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling and latent growth curve models.","Fit linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models. The models and their components are represented using S4 classes and methods. The core computational algorithms are implemented using the Eigen C++ library for numerical linear algebra and RcppEigen ""glue"".","mokken contains functions for performing Mokken scale analysis on test and questionnaire data. It includes an automated item selection algorithm, and various checks of model assumptions.",For parameter estimation of item response theory (IRT) models,The Simple C++ Numerical Toolkit (SCPPNT) consists of a set of classes and functions that implement simple dense matrix and vector classes and some associated algorithms. ,"Item Response Theory, Item Response Theory Linking and Equating, Test Scaling, Frequency Analysis, Descriptive Statistics, Item Analysis, DIF Analysis, Kernel Density Estimation, Nonparametric Item Response Theory Characteristic Curve Estimation","ConstructMap?can run analyses on dichotomous data using the Rasch Model or on polytomous data using the Partial Credit Model or the Rating Scale Model. In addition to the model results, ConstructMap can produce several plots, such as Wright Maps, Item Fit Plots and Item Characteristic Curves, to help in the interpretation of those results.","TAP is a classical test and item analysis program.  It provides reports for examinee total scores, item statistics (e.g., difficulty, discrimination), options analyses, and other useful information.  TAP also provides individual examinee reports of total scores and item responses.",Test variously scored items and bundles of items (a bundle viewed as a collection) for various kinds of DIF,DIM-Pack provides tools for conducting statistical dimensionality analyses on assessments consisting of dichotomously scored tasks,IRT graphical residual analysis,WinGen supports various IRT models. WinGen generates IRT model parameter values from various distributions for realistic data.,IRT,calibrating items and individuals using the 1 & 3 parameter logistic item response theory models. Parameterization uses Newton-Raphson maximum likelihood estimation as outlined in Lord (1980).,"IATA is a software package for analysing psychometric and educational assessment data. It performs factor analysis, item response theory (IRT) scaling and calibration, differential item functioning (DIF) analysis, computer aided test development, equating, IRT-based standard setting, score conditioning, and plausible value generation. ","Multiple-Choice, Rating Scale and Partial Credit Rasch Analysis","Facets is designed to handle really tough applications of unidimensional Rasch measurement. It constructs measures from complex data involving heterogeneous combinations of examinees, items, tasks, judges along with further measurement and structural facets. It is designed to handle flexibly combinations of items of different formats in one analysis. Item types include dichotomies, rating scales with up to 255 categories, Poisson counts and Bernoulli trials. Multiple different measurement models can be included in the same analysis, including paired-comparisons, rank- order, rating scales, partial credit and dichotomizations involving from 1 to 255 facets. Measures can also be fixed (anchored) individually or by group mean, facilitating equating and linking across test sessions. Quality-control fit evaluation of all measures is provided. Unexpected data points are identified. Bias, differential item functioning and interactions can be measured. Weighting schemes can be implemented. Up to 1 million examinees etc. can be included in one analysis. Typical applications have over 90% missing data. Since organizing the data for input to Facets and then interpreting its output can be challenging, it is recommended that simpler approaches be tried first. Facets has been used successfully to construct measures for medical staff performance, patient performance, public speaking, sports performance by individuals and teams, and consumer preferences. Training seminars are held regularly.","multilevel, multidimensional, and multiple group item response theory (IRT) software package for item analysis and test scoring"
