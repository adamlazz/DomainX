In addition, it has been designed such that it can easily be coupled to 3-D circulation models, and used as a module for the computation of vertical turbulent mixing. The core of the model computes solutions for the one-dimensional versions of the transport equations of momentum, salt and heat. The key component in solving these equations is the model for the turbulent fluxes of these quantities.","The MITgcm (MIT General Circulation Model) is a numerical model designed for study of the atmosphere, ocean, and climate. Its non-hydrostatic formulation enables it to simulate fluid phenomena over a wide range of scales; its adjoint capability enables it to be applied to parameter and state estimation problems.
